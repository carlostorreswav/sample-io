# sample-io

sample-io is a macOS Electron React App for music producers to organize samples and filter them by tone/tempo/tags and drag and drop them directly on a DAW

I'm developing this app with the Lean Startup framework, so I'm delivering installables for the application to early adopters who kindly help me in build something actually usefull for professional music producers.
